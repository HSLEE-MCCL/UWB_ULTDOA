# UWB_ULTDOA
Uplink (Observed) TDOA with Wireless Clock Synchronization



This repository introduces and provides implementation code for achieving Uplink TDOA (UL-TDOA) using Qorvo's DW3000 UWB transceivers.
The proposed method that synchronizes the clocks of slave anchors to the clock of the master anchor.
It achieves a clock synchronization accuracy with a standard deviation of 0.27 ps using basic crystal oscillators (i.e., without TCXO).
The current implementation is limited to a single-hop setup, with plans to generalize it to multi-hop in the future.
