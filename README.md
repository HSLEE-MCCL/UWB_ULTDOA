# UWB_ULTDOA
Uplink (Observed) TDOA with Wireless Clock Synchronization



This repository introduces and provides implementation code for achieving Uplink TDOA (UL-TDOA) using Qorvo's DW3000 UWB transceivers.

The proposed method that synchronizes the clocks of slave anchors to the clock of the master anchor.

It achieves a clock synchronization accuracy with a standard deviation of 0.27 ns using basic crystal oscillators (i.e., without TCXO).

The current implementation is limited to a single-hop setup, with plans to generalize it to multi-hop in the future.

Note that the proposed method is not compatible with one-way ranging (OWR) procedure on IEEE 802.15.4z.


TBD
